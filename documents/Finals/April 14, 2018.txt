Server-Side Web Scripting

Java Servlets
	-java objects that are intended to play the rule of the server components
in the client-server communications
	-handles client requests by generating responses to such requests
	-part of the Java EE specification
	-hosted in a 'servlet container' that provides the environment in which the servlet
runs as well as controls the 'servlet lifecycle'
	
	Class Generic Servlet
	init -initialization
	services
	destroy - application will have to stop

Servlet Lifecycle
	The lifecycle of a servlet is controlled by a container 
	*instantiation - constructor call
		-create an instance of the servlet to service client requests
		-invoked implicitly by the servlet
	*initialization - init()- invoked only once
	
	service() method - invoked for each client requests

	destruction - destroy() method - invoked before the servlet instance in 'unloaded'

HttpServlet
	-Java servlet used to handle Http requests and generate Http response
	-hosted in a 'web container' which is a component ina a Java 'application
server'
	-the service()method call is routed to a doXXX() call, depending on the Http
request
	-the doXXX() methods are passed by two arguments
	*HttpServletRequest
		-object representation of the Http request sent by the client and received
by the servlet
	*HttpServletResponse
		-object representation of the Http response generated by the servlet and send back
to the requesting client
