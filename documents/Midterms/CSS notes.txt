CSS Values:
INITIAL VALUE
The initial value is the default value of a CSS property, the usage of the initial value depends
	on whether a property is inherited or not.
 -Inherited properties is used only on the root element, when no specified value is given 
 -Non-inherited properties is used on all elements, when no specified value is given
 
COMPUTED VALUE
The computed value is the value that is transferred from parent to child during inheritance. It 
	can be calculated from the specified value by
 -Handling special values of inherit, initial, unset or revert
 -Manually computing to reach the needed value showed in the computed value from the property's
  definition table
  
USED VALUE
The used value is the value calculated on the computed value. 
After a user agent finished all calculations, every properties has a used value. Used values are in pixels 
and shorthand properties are consistent with those of their component properties.

ACTUAL VALUE
The actual value is the used value of a property after approximations have been applied
Steps to calculate actual value of a property:
-The specified value is determined by the result of cascading, inheritance or initial value
-The computed value is calculated according to the specification
-Layout is calculated, resulting in used value
-The used value is transformed according to the limitations resulting in the actual value
