    <h2><span>Why is HTTP a Stateless Communication Protocol? </span> </h2>
    <h3>
&emsp;HTTP can handle multiple requests in a single connection, however, the server does not affix a tag to the requests arriving the socket. HTTP keeps a stateless communication protocol for performance boost. This protocol enables HTTP to minimize the bandwidth that would be spent renewing the connection for each request.<br><br>

&emsp;HTTP Provides Support for Other Functionalities<br><br>
Aside from being a mere application layer protocol, HTTP offers more functionalities such as caching which is a method that stores a duplicate of a resource and delivers it when requested. This eases the load of the server from serving all the clients by itself. HTTP also support setting up of Cookies. A web cookie is a small data that the server delivers to the browser. It stores information as HTTP is a stateless protocol.

    <h2><span>Using HTTP for Secure Transmissions</span> </h2>
    <h3>
      &emsp;At the end of 1994, Netscape Communication added an encrypted transmission layer for HTTP. This paved way for the start of electronic commerce in web sites. Academic networks, advertisers, and privacy found their way with the flourishing functionality of security.<br><br>

      Using HTTP for Complex Applications<br><br>
&emsp;The introduction of more sophisticated Application Programming Interface (API)â€™s enabled developers to create fine web applications. Advanced extensions and new HTTP headers improved the protocols functionality
