    <h2><span>HTTP Based on Client-Server Architecture </span> </h2>
    <h3>
&emsp;To understand client server architecture let us begin by having a situation. For instance, you need to get the latest news in your local are. For this case let us say that computer do not exist. So in order to know about the city you will need to rely on other people for information.<br>
&emsp;In this case, we have to different participants. First there is you, the one who seeks information about the city. The other one are the people whom you rely on information. If we are to breakdown these two participants we get:<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;a.  Consumer, who desires to acquire certain information. This is known as the Client in a Client-Server architecture.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;b.  Provider, the one who supplies information. Also known as the Server in a Client-Server Architecture<br><br>
&emsp;In today&rsquo;s scenario, a client and a server are different entities that are connected through internet in the World Wide Web. Though in some cases a server and a client could run in one computer. These are possible with<br> <br>
&emsp;&emsp;a.  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol that acts as a medium of communication for computers and devices.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;b.  Extensible Markup Language (XML) &ndash; is a metalanguage which enables users to define and change their markup languages.

    <h2><span>HTTP Request-Response Standard Protocol</span> </h2>
    <h3>
&emsp;Request-response, also known as request-reply, is one of the most common structure that computers utilize to communicate with each other. For example, computer A sends a request for data exchange computer B then responds to the request. In that case of the accessing the World Wide Web, browsing websites turn to request-response communication. When a person browses a web page, his/her computer requests for the contents of the webpage to be displayed. The host or the server then issues a response by sending the content of the webpage such as the texts, images, or applications. This communication protocol is widely used in client-server architectures.<br><br><br>

      HTTP is a Stateless Communication Protocol<br><br>
&emsp;A stateless protocol is a communication protocol wherein no information is saved and stored by either the sender or the receiver. The sender sends a packet to the receiver, however, it does not anticipate an approval or a receipt. The most obvious example of a stateless protocol is the User Diagram Protocol because the system does not store its contents during the session. The Internet Protocol and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol are also stateless communication protocols.
